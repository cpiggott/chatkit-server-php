## Installation

**We recommend you [use composer](http://getcomposer.org/).**

You can get the Chatkit PHP SDK via a composer package called `pusher-chatkit-server`. See <https://packagist.org/packages/pusher/pusher-chatkit-server>

```bash
$ composer require pusher/pusher-chatkit-server
```

Or add to `composer.json`:

```json
"require": {
    "pusher/pusher-chatkit-server": "^1.0.0"
}
```

and then run `composer update`.

Or you can clone or download the SDK files.

This SDK depends on PHP modules for cURL and JSON. See [cURL module installation instructions](http://php.net/manual/en/curl.installation.php) and [JSON module installation instructions](http://php.net/manual/en/json.installation.php).
